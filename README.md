# Baby_Health_Monitoring_System
This is Major Project of 4th year BE (7th &amp; 8th Semesters). An Internet of Things-Based Baby Health Monitoring System is proposed as an efficient and low-cost IOT-based system for monitoring in real time. We are working on a new algorithm for our system that plays a key role in providing better baby care while parents are away.
